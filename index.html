<h3>Personal information</h3>

<p>Hi,my name is Jiaqi guan(s3815613) but you can also call me jack which is much
  easier to pronounce and remember. I am currently a first year student in the
  Bachelor of IT. My e-mail address is s3815613@student.rmit.edu.au. I'm from
  south part of China, a city call GuangZhou. It's the largest and oldest trading
  port and also the one of the major city in China. Base on my life experience,
  I can speak up to three language which is mandarin, Cantonese and English.
  In my spare time I enjoy video games the most, especially FPS and hardcore game.
  Such as "Escape from Tarkov". But i also enjoy some outdoor activity as well,
  such as badminton and hiking. And my favourite pet is dog. This is it about
  myself :)</p>

<h3>Interest to IT</h3>
<p>I have been exposed to the application of it when I was in junior high school.
Internet hacking was my first impression of this industry, and I have been
interested in it ever since. The reason why I choose to study IT is that the IT
industry has developed faster and faster in recent years, and it will definitely
become one of the most important careers in the future. Moreover, this industry
is diverse, and all network-related industries will need the IT people. Choosing
this industry can lead to better employment opportunities in the future. The reason
of why I choose to study at RMIT was because of the recommendation of a friend
and the advantage of the location. And I also hope that I can master the use of
languages such as python, java, etc., and learn about IT security in the upcoming
years of studying at rmit.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.idrlabs.com/multiple-intelligences/test.php">link</a></p>
<p>The job will require someone to provide tech support in cybersecurity for
  Northern Star. I chose this job because I think it is related to the subjects
  I am studying now.It is mainly used to protect the data of Northern Star and their
  suppliers, as well as the routine maintenance of the protection system. And also
  provides guidance and training for junior IT staff. To successfully get this
  job, you need to have work experience in a similar position and the corresponding
  education. At the same time, it requires you to have a high degree of integrity
  and social skills. For now, my abilities do not match the requirements of this
  job. I only have half a year of C++ learning experience and simple use of html.
  I plan to obtain the academic requirements in university studies and gain
  practical experience in a possible university internship in the future. </p>

<p>After completing these three personality tests, I have a clearer understanding
  of my abilities and areas of expertise. At the same time, I also aware of my
  flaws and ways to improve. To be honest, I don't think this test has any effect
  on my behaviour in the team. First of all, I am a gregarious person and I enjoy
  and want to do group activities with others. Secondly, the test results also
  show that I am a person who likes to socialize. Using individual behavioural
  strengths to create a harmonious team can greatly improve team and individual
  performance. There are no perfect individuals but perfect teams. Everyone has
  a role that suits them best in the team. Some people are suitable for the role
  of leader and creator and some people like to play the role of coordinator and
  executor. I think I can be a good coordinator when forming a team.</p>
