<h3>Personal information</h3>

<p>Hi,my name is Jiaqi guan(s3815613) but you can also call me jack which is much
  easier to pronounce and remember. I am currently a first year student in the
  Bachelor of IT. My e-mail address is s3815613@student.rmit.edu.au. I'm from
  south part of China, a city call GuangZhou. It's the largest and oldest trading
  port and also the one of the major city in China. Base on my life experience,
  I can speak up to three language which is mandarin, Cantonese and English.
  In my spare time I enjoy video games the most, especially FPS and hardcore game.
  Such as "Escape from Tarkov". But i also enjoy some outdoor activity as well,
  such as badminton and hiking. And my favourite pet is dog. This is it about
  myself :)</p>

<h3>Inerest to IT</h3>
<p>I have been exposed to the application of it when I was in junior high school.
Internet hacking was my first impression of this industry, and I have been
interested in it ever since. The reason why I choose to study IT is that the IT
industry has developed faster and faster in recent years, and it will definitely
become one of the most important careers in the future. Moreover, this industry
is diverse, and all network-related industries will need the IT people. Choosing
this industry can lead to better employment opportunities in the future. The reason
of why I choose to study at RMIT was because of the recommendation of a friend
and the advantage of the location. And I also hope that I can master the use of
languages such as python, java, etc., and learn about IT security in the upcoming
years of studying at rmit.</p>
